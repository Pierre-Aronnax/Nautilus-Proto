# Nautilus Prototype

**Nautilus** is an experimental library designed to help explore and develop decentralized applications (DApps). It focuses on testing new ideas, technologies, and security models in the evolving Web3.0 ecosystem.

Nautilus aims to bridge the gap between current decentralized technologies and emerging concepts, integrating both traditional security measures and post-quantum cryptography (PQC) for future-proofing communications in decentralized networks.

## Key Features

- **Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) Support:** Nautilus explores the use of post-quantum cryptographic algorithms to prepare decentralized systems for future security challenges.

- **Decentralized Communication:** While building on existing technologies, Nautilus aims to experiment with new ways to improve decentralized communication and security.

- **Open-Ended Exploration:** Nautilus is a platform for experimenting with emerging technologies in Web3.0, encouraging new approaches that go beyond conventional frameworks.

- **Security Models:** In addition to traditional security methods, Nautilus introduces new and experimental models for securing decentralized applications.

- **Prototype & Proof-of-Concept:** Nautilus is still in early development, intended to explore and test decentralized principles rather than replace or compete with existing solutions.


## Modules

Nautilus is built with a modular approach, allowing experimentation and extension across various components. The current core modules include:

- **Core**: The foundational module that powers the basic functionality of Nautilus. It includes essential utilities and core abstractions for decentralized communication.

- **Discovery**: A module responsible for node discovery and peer-to-peer network connectivity, allowing nodes to find and communicate with each other within the decentralized network.

- **Identity**: This module handles identity management and authentication for decentralized applications. It focuses on secure identity creation, verification, and management.

- **Logger**: A simple yet flexible logging system designed for debugging and monitoring within Nautilus, providing visibility into the internal workings of the system.

### Upcoming Modules

In addition to the existing modules, the following features are in development:

- **Routing**: A module for enabling efficient routing and data forwarding across the decentralized network. It will explore new and scalable methods for node-to-node communication.

- **TLSLayer**: A secure transport layer that integrates TLS (Transport Layer Security) for encrypted communication, providing an added security layer to ensure private and secure data exchange between peers.
